## Introduction

In this project, I conducted a transactional sales analysis with an excel dataset sourced from Kaggle using SQL. 

### Objectives
The objectives of this project are as follows:
- Design a normalised relational data model
- Estimate revenue and analyse product performance
- Identify revenue drivers and discount effectiveness
- Present data-driven insights

## Dataset
The excel dataset was obtained from Kaggle. It consists of 1000 rows and 9 columns. In order to make use of the dataset, an ETL process has to take place from Excel to SQL Server Management Studion(SSMS). To view the initial Excel dataset, click ![](dataset/retail_sales_dataset.csv)
