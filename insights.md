# Executive Summary
This project analyzes retail transaction data using a SQL Server star schema to uncover key revenue drivers, customer purchasing behavior, and category-level performance trends. The goal is to generate actionable business insights that support marketing prioritization and sales strategy decisions.

## Key Findings
| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Total Revenue | £456,000 |
| Top Category | Electronics (£156,905) |
| Highest AOV Category | Beauty (£184.06 avg price/unit) |
| Revenue Concentration | Top 20% customers contribute 63% |


## Customer Insights
- The 46–60 age group represents the largest proportion of customers and also generates the highest total revenue among all demographics. This indicates that mid-to-late career consumers form the business’s most valuable customer segment. Targeted retention strategies and tailored marketing campaigns aimed at this demographic could help maximize revenue and strengthen long-term customer value

## Product Insights
- Electronics should be prioritized for marketing because it generates the highest total revenue and maintains strong transaction volume, indicating proven customer demand. Targeted campaigns could further scale the category’s contribution to overall sales
- Beauty products show the highest average order value, suggesting premium purchasing behavior. Marketing investment could expand adoption and increase high-margin revenue
- Electronics is the current revenue leader, while Beauty products represent a high-value growth opportunity

## Time Trends
- Sales exhibit moderate seasonality, with revenue peaking in Q4 and dipping in Q2. This suggests stronger customer demand toward the end of the year, potentially influenced by holiday-related spending and promotional activity. However, overall sales remain relatively stable across the remaining quarters, indicating that seasonality has a limited but noticeable impact on revenue performance.
- The largest month-over-month revenue increase occurs in:
October 2023

+97.2% MoM growth
This sharp increase follows a weaker performance in September, indicating a strong rebound rather than continuous exponential growth.
- The steepest monthly decline was recorded at:

−36.1% MoM decrease

This decline suggests some mid-year softening in demand, although overall sales remain relatively stable outside the Q4 surge.


  
## Recommendations

- **Prioritize the Electronics category for marketing investment**, as it is the largest revenue contributor and shows consistently high transaction volume. Scaling demand here will have the strongest immediate impact on overall revenue.

- **Promote Beauty products through premium bundles and upselling strategies**, since this category demonstrates the highest average order value and represents a high-margin growth opportunity.

- **Focus retention and loyalty campaigns on the 46–60 customer segment**, as this demographic represents the largest and most valuable revenue-driving group.

- **Align promotional activity with seasonal peaks**, particularly in Q4 when demand is highest, while using targeted incentives in Q2 to address the mid-year revenue dip.

- **Mitigate revenue concentration risk by expanding engagement beyond top customers**, since the top 20% of customers contribute a majority of sales. Diversifying the customer base can improve long-term stability.
